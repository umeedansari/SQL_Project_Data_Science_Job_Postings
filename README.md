# My First Data Analysis Project

I'm excited to share my first data analysis project, where I explored the data analyst job market using SQL. This project helped me learn and practice my SQL skills, and I'm happy to share my findings with you.

## What I Did
I analyzed data from job postings to answer some questions:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are in high demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## Tools I Used
I used the following tools for this project:

- SQL: I learned how to write SQL queries to extract insights from the data.
- PostgreSQL: I used PostgreSQL as my database management system.
- Visual Studio Code: I used VS Code to write and execute my SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: I used Git and GitHub to version control my code and share my project with others.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with SQL and learned how to:

- Write complex SQL queries
- Join tables and use subqueries
- Use aggregate functions to summarize data
- Analyze data to answer real-world questions

## Insights
Here are some key insights I gained from my analysis:
